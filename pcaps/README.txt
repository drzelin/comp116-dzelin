10) There are 77982 packets in set2.pcap.

	Username:	 larry@radsot.com
	Password:	 Z3lenzmej
	Protocol:    IMAP
	Server IP:   76.0d.78.57.d6.net
	Domain Name: dom.bg
	Port Number: 143
14) I can tell that the username and password for larry@radsot.com are valid because the emails between him and other sources are visible when looking through wireshark. For example, it is clear that on Friday August 7, 2015 Larry canceled an amazon order of "Pioneer DDJ-SB Performance...". He received an email for "order-update@amazon.com" that has the subject that he canceled this order. Like this amazon order, there are several other emails that can be viewed.
