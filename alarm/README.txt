Readme for Assignment 2
Due 10/13/15

1) To my knowledge everything in this assignment has been implemented correctly. This includes reading the live packets and web server logs to determine if an attack has been performed. 

2) I collaborated with Daniel Baigel, Zach Kirsch, Becky Cutler, and Michael Seltzer

3) I have spent approximately 8 hours on this assignmnet. This includes learning about packetfu, learning Ruby syntax, understanding all of the types of scans and attacks, and determining how to check if these attacks have been performed.


1) I think the heuristics used in this assignment are okay. i say that becuase if a person knows that this attack-detecter exists (especially for general Nmap scnas, Nikto scnas, and any other attacks that just involve searching if certain expressions exist) is easy to prevent those expressions from being displayed in the packets. This includes private searches and other methods that can cover up what attacks have been performed. However, when testing the flags, I think this assignment handles those attacks well and are challenging (as an attacker) to avoid.

2) I would test for more scans using the different flags. I would also
